# Skill Share

## 7 Days to Die Modlet

I do not own this code, this code was designed by Zorora, and props should be given to him for the thousands of lines of text he whote to make this mod work in its initial state. I just stepped in and added some syntax that brought the rest of the mod to working order.

Also there was a mention about orange dye that I have no idea about, I was only focusing on the "skill share" part of the mod so I don't know if the dye works or is even implemented.
